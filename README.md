# hello-world

Hi Everyone!

My name is Roshan Ghimeray and I am a student at YearUp program. I like big data mining and, as of activities I like to hike and travel around to different state to explore cultural sites and history behind it.
I've been enaged with yearup program to learn new sets of skills and learn to develop professional habits.
